# CSharpFunctionalExtensions.Linq

This package provides a set of useful extension methods for working with `IEnumerable<T>`, helping you to handle common scenarios (like retrieving elements or handling empty sequences) in a functional style. It uses types like `Result<T>`, `Maybe<T>`, to make code more expressive and handle errors in a more functional manner.

## Features

The package includes several extension methods that help to:

- Safely retrieve elements from a sequence (by index or via predicates)
- Handle empty sequences with custom error handling
- Convert sequences into non-empty lists
- Work with `Maybe<T>` to represent optional values
